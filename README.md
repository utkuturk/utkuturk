### Hi there 👋

Hi, I am Utku Türk, PhD student in [the Department of Linguistics][departmentumd], [University of Maryland, College Park][umd] under the supervision of [Colin Phillips][colin] and [Ellen Lau][ellen].

I completed my MA in [the Department of Linguistics][department], [Boğaziçi University][uni] where I also worked as Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant. My MA thesis supervised by [Pavel Logačev][pavel] is about agrement attraction effects in Turkish, focusing on the effects of response bias in agreement attraction and whether or not everyone is affected uniformly by the bias-related manipulations. Moreover, I also investigated the effects of case ambiguity, register, and task dependencies. You can also check my [CV][cv]!
  
  
I am interested in morphology and its interaction with semantics and phonology. I was lucky to join [Pavel Caha][caha] at [Masaryk University][mas] to work on various topics including Turkish case syncretism, augmentatives, and suspended affixation.
  
I am an [Universal Dependencies][ud] enthusiast. I participated in the creation Turkish and Laz treebanks. I am currently working on a Romeyka and Ladino treebanks.   
  
In my freetime, I usually play games on [Steam][steam] or take amateur [photographs][flickr]. My favorite food is [gata][gata] with koritz and my favorite icecream flavor is [saffron and rose][rose].
